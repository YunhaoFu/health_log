### **2023.05.17** - the 2nd time when I get a similar *huge* stomache. The reason is also placed below:
1. food induced stomache
2. irregular diet and unhealty living habbit

### Thinking about my future in abroad with no one can help, I dicide to make a *serious* log related to my everyday life, including the time for getting up, going to bed, time for 3 meals and time for body-movement. Instead of making log with *qualitative description*, I'll make a *quantitative analysis* starting with at least 2dimension, i.e. time and space (more can be included for the menu of each meal). Also data for daily health is saved. With this I want to discover which is the best way to maintain life, work and fun.

#### This experiment will be carried out by python code and the data will be saved in NETCDF4 format file. (2023.05.17)
